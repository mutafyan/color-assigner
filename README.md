# Color Assigner App

Enter your name and get assigned a color. The app uses [*Google Sheets*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JiGNDzP4BbRDY-fgwYg-dhldLHFYzI7PulDO-qN0Jhk/edit?gid=0#gid=0) as a mini backend, there we have 2 sheets:

 1) Participants
 2) Available Colors

*Apps Script* is used for accessing the sheets with apis.
